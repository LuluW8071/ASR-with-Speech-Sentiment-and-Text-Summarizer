To begin this project, use the included `Makefile`

#### Creating Virtual Environment

This package is built using `python-3.8`. 
We recommend creating a virtual environment and using a matching version to ensure compatibility.

#### pre-commit

`pre-commit` will automatically format and lint your code. You can install using this by using
`make use-pre-commit`. It will take effect on your next `git commit`

#### pip-tools

The method of managing dependencies in this package is using `pip-tools`. To begin, run `make use-pip-tools` to install. 

Then when adding a new package requirement, update the `requirements.in` file with 
the package name. You can include a specific version if desired but it is not necessary. 

To install and use the new dependency you can run `make deps-install` or equivalently `make`

If you have other packages installed in the environment that are no longer needed, you can you `make deps-sync` to ensure that your current development environment matches the `requirements` files.
